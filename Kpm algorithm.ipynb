The idea is to create a lookup table that tells us how many characters we can skip by using the previous comparisons. In order to do that, we need to find the longest prefix that is also a suffix for each prefix of the needle, so basically if there are set of characters that are repeated in the needle. We then need to have an algorithm to find the longest common prefix for every possible substring of the needle."
